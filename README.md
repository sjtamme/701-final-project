# 701 Final Project 

This project uses [Panel Truck](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/documentation/panel-truck.html), a web UI tool for creating interactions with maps and images. My project allows the viewer to interact with a historical map, <b>National highways map of the United States showing one hundred fifty thousand miles of national highway</b>.

As the user interacts with the map, aspects of the map are explained in relation to readings from the MAP 701 course. The following readings are referenced:

- Judith Tyner, “Persuasive Cartography,” in Mark Monmonier, ed., The History of Cartography, vol. 6 (University of Chicago Press, 2015): 1087–1095.

- Jeremy Crampton, “The Power of Maps,” in Paul Cloke, Philip Crang, and Mark Goodwin, eds., Introducing Human Geographies (Routledge, 2013): 192–202.

- Susan Schulten, “The Cartographic Consolidation of America.” In Mapping the Nation: History and Cartography in Nineteenth-Century America, (University of Chicago Press, 2012): 157–95.
